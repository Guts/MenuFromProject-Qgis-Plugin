    <h1>Build layers shortcut menu based on QGIS project</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
Allow easy opening of layers maintaining their style.

<h2>Principle</h2>
<p>When the plugin is configured (choice of a project via the plugin menu), a new menu appears, based on all the layers that contain the original project.</p>
<p>Tip : a separator can be configured by creating (in the original project) a layer group named "-"</p>
<p>Attention : the project must be configured to record absolute paths</p>
<p>The project might be stored in a PostgreSQL database. You need to copy/paste the project path (Project properties -> General) into the field.</p>

<p>Option of the plugin "Load all layers item" if it is checked load all the layers of the same level submenu</p>
<p>"Create group" option put the new layer in a group with the name of the parent level menu (v 1.9)</p>
<p>You can hide the administration dialog of the plugin by adding a <em>menu_from_project/is_setup_visible</em> to <em>false</em> in the QGIS INI file. This is useful when you deploy QGIS within an organization.</p>
